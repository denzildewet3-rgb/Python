# Chat GPT Summary
# This program conducts a simple poll asking users which mountain they would like to climb.
# It starts with an empty dictionary (responses) to store names and their answers.
# The while loop keeps running as long as polling_active is True.

# Inside the loop:
# The program asks for the userâ€™s name and their desired mountain.
# It then stores this information in the dictionary (responses[name] = response).
# The user is asked if another person wants to respond; if they type 'n', polling stops.
# After polling ends, the program prints all the collected responses, showing which mountain each person wants to climb.
